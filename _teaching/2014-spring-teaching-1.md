Textbook
Cay Horstmann, Java Concepts: Late Objects Enhanced e-Text (3rd edition), John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ISBN: 978-1-119-32102-6.  You may purchase a code for it at the bookstore or directly from the publisher via this link. Note that this is the same textbook that is used in CSE 2123.
The textbook has a companion site with videos, examples and source code that may be of use to you.  You can find it at this link.
The 2nd edition - Java for Everyone: Late Objects (2nd edition) is also allowed if you would prefer to buy used or have a physical textbook.  The information is the same but you will not have access to the online exercises that provide additional practice.  The eText is strongly recommended over the 2nd edition.
A digital version of the 2nd edition is available via the campus subscription to Safari Books Online. If you click on this link you will be taken to the OSU library catalog page for the digital version of the 2nd edition. If you click the Safari Online link you will be prompted to create an account linked to your Ohio State e-mail address that will allow you to use it, and then you can search the Safari/O'Reilly site for "Java for Everyone" to read it. Be aware that this version is just a straight conversion of the 2nd edition text and does not contain the online activities of the enhanced 3rd edition eText you can purchase. Once you have an account there are also apps available for your mobile devices that will allow you to read the text through the app rather than the website.
