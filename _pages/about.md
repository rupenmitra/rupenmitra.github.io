I am a doctoral student in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), UK. I am working in the research group led by [Dr. Mahesh K. Marina](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/). I received MS degrees in computer science and engineering from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) and the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/), OH, USA.


Research
======
Broadly, my research interests sprawl in the cross-section of **Networked-Systems**, **Mobile Networking**, and **Network Security**. More specifically, my current research endeavors encompass the following areas

1. 5G Network Security
2. Security of Mobile systems 
3. Application of Machine Learning in networking 
4. Adversarial risks of machine learning in mobile networking

 My undergraduate research was in the area of wireless communication and image processing.
