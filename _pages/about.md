My research focuses on designing machine learning based intelligent networking algorithm for 5G mobile networking and wireless communication. I am working in the research group led by Dr. Mahesh K. Marina. I received MS degrees in computer science and engineering from The Ohio State University and the University of Cincinnati, OH, USA.
