I am a doctoral student in the School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh, UK. My research focuses on designing machine learning based algorithms for low latency 5G systems and mobile networking. I am working in the research group led by Dr. Mahesh K. Marina. I received MS degrees in computer science and engineering from The Ohio State University and the University of Cincinnati, OH, USA.
